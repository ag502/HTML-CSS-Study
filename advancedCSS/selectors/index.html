      <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
      <p>
        Contrary to popular belief, <a href="">Lorem</a> Ipsum is not simply
        random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from
        45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
        Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,
        from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
        classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

          It <strong>has <em>survived</em></strong
          >. <a href="">not only five</a> centuries, but also the leap into
          electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
